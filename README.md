# ws23-feedback-pouring
Pouring the liquid/cereals using the Kinova arm with force estimation feedback


## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of feedback-controlled pouring using a Kinova robotic arm and the Kortex API. The goal is to accurately estimate the pouring weight using a wrench estimator to provide feedback control during pouring tasks.

This repository is developed by the Autonomous Systems group at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. The code in this repository is Kortex API-based and is developed using a single Kinova arm.

# Dependencies

This repository depends on the below components. 

`Kinova Kortex API`
`KDL (Kinematics and Dynamics Library)`
`URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) Parser`
`External Wrench Estimator`
